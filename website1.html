                <p id="poppin"> Pizza is the best food because your ability to use your imagination and creatiivty when creating a pizza has no limits. The combinations of toppings are endless, even if you're just a plain cheese type of guy.  </p>

                <p id="par2"> When looking at a pizza you get a nice display of the food groups. The crust is made of grains, the cheese (or not if you're vegan) has dairy, the sauce is made of tomatoes which is your vegetable (fruit?), and the toppings you add is just more to love. When it comes to pizza theres really nothing not to love.</p>
